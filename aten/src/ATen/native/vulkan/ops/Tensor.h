//
// This class represents a Vulkan tensor and provides an abstraction layer
// that allows both the CPU, and the GPU, to view a Vulkan (buffer, image)
// pair as one coherent, synchronized unit of storage on both UMA and NUMA
// systems.  Expanding on the previous sentence, this class tries to address
// two orthogonal implementation complexities that arise as a result of the
// aforementioned goal of memory coherence:
//
// 1) First, synchronization across processors; CPUs and GPUs are separate
//    processors, and even though they share the same address space in a system
//    with a unified memory architecture, their address spaces only partially
//    overlap on NUMA.  Consequently on NUMA, while it is still technically
//    possible to take advantage of this shared address space to maintain one
//    single copy of the data, different access latencies from CPU and GPU to
//    this shared location usually necessitates maintaining two copies each in
//    processor-local memory, otherwise memory access latency will hurt from
//    the processor to which this data is not close.  This shared memory is more
//    often than not located in system memory, making for slow GPU read and
//    write access over the PCI-e bus.  Maintaining two separate copies on the
//    other hand, requires synchronization to guarantee coherence.  This is
//    not an issue on UMA and this implementation accounts for that optimization.
//
// 2) Second, synchronization across resources (i.e. buffers and images); GPU
//    drivers pack images in proprietory formats for better locality of access
//    and to enable lossless compression.  These conversions are both expensive
//    (in general) and manual (in Vulkan.)  This requires a second order of
//    synchronization to guarantee coherence between the contents of the buffer
//    and image otherwise they will go out of sync.
//
// It is extremely important to keep in mind that the functionality this class
// provides is generally expensive.  For optimal performance, the user of this
// class should:
//
// 1) Avoid frequent CPU <=> GPU transfers which will be triggered if data is
//    write accessed on one processor and read / write accessed on the other.
//
// 2) Avoid frequent buffer <=> image conversions which will be trigerred if
//    data is write accessed as a buffer (image) and read accessed as an
//    image (buffer).
//
// For optimal performance, access the data as images, and keep the data on GPU,
// and above all understand the expensive data flow that this class abstracts
// away.
//
// vTensor tries to address a specific concern and intentionally does not expose
// GPU tensor memory directly.  Please keep it that behavior intact as the whole
// data model fundamentally depends on limiting what the user can achieve through
// the interface to guarantee performance and coherence.
